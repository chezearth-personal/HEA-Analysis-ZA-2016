# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THIS REPOSITORY

In GitHub, files are stored in _repositories_ (often called "repos", for short), which are public and can be viewed by anybody. However, changes to the original files can only be made or approved (after a **pull request**) by the **owners** of the repositories.

To obtain a complete carbon-copy of the files in this repository, simply click `download ZIP` and GitHub will send you a zip archive download of the latest version of all files and folders in the repository (in this case, `hea_za_spreadsheets`). If you go to a specific file and click on it, GitHub will try to open it but if this file is of an unrecognised or closed format (such as `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.docx` or `.doc`), it will offer instead the option of downloading and viewing the file -- from where you can do your thing using your vendor's overpriced _legacy_ software).

Github will not track the individual changes in Excel files, but it will keep a record of each file committed to the repo. So, if a file is edited, the _entire_ new version of the file will be sent to the repo, not just the changes as is the case with a text or ascii file (like this `.md` file). This is totally painful but is a shortcoming of using spreadsheets, which are a completely innapropriate tool for data storage in the 21st Century!

If you want to work on the files and change them you will have to **fork** the repository to create a new _branch_. Then you **clone** the file you want to work on to your new branch (always include `za_expandabilityfactors.xlsx` in the clone) and then, if you and the owner are happy with you changes, you can do a **pull request** to _merge_ the two files together.

I am busy working on some VBA to install in each spreadsheet to automatically re-write the entire thing JSON, which is a _much_ better format. The results will look something like the JSON files in the `livelihoods` repo. While the JSON file might not at first appear as user-friendly to the uninitiated as an Excel file does when it's opened in Excel itself, it is machine readable and _does_ allow easy web and app development --I mean, who still has Excel installed on their computers and if they do, can they view Excel spreadsheets on their phones or other devices as well?! This will ultimately leading to massive scaled-out public sharing of HEA data, which can only be a good thing.
