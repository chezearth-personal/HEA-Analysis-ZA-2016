# HEA Analysis South Africa 2016

This is the repo: HEA-Analysis-ZA-2016, and the folder with the repo is `~/Documents/hea_analysis/south_africa/2016.04` on my disk.

Collection of folders:
* [./extra_baselines](https://github.com/CharlesRethman/HEA-Analysis-ZA-2016/tree/master/extra_baselines): Extra baselines information:
  * Rural farmworkers.
  * Urban dwellers. Their baseline and analysis sheet is largely built up out of NIDS data.
  * Synthesis-zones for the remaining open access livelihood zones aggregated from the 14 exsiting baselines.
* [./graphics](https://github.com/CharlesRethman/HEA-Analysis-ZA-2016/tree/master/graphics): set of maps and images feeding into and resulting from the analysis;
* [./met](https://github.com/CharlesRethman/HEA-Analysis-ZA-2016/tree/master/met): NDVI and other images on drought spatial distribution, as well as set of shape files for trimming all the junk off the edges of the NDVI image;
* [./maps](https://github.com/CharlesRethman/HEA-Analysis-ZA-2016/tree/master/maps): QGIS map files for analysis of drought extent, affected populations, livelihood zones;
* [./pop](https://github.com/CharlesRethman/HEA-Analysis-ZA-2016/tree/master/pop): various Excel and and CSV files with population and affected numbers analsyis. The Excel files (especially `outcomes.xlsx`) contain valuable pivot tables of outcomes and affected population/deficit calculations.
* [./crops](https://github.com/CharlesRethman/HEA-Analysis-ZA-2016/tree/master/crops): Crop Estimates Committee (CEC) data and various agricultural census documents from BFAP and DAFF.
* [./prices](https://github.com/CharlesRethman/HEA-Analysis-ZA-2016/tree/master/prices): data (mostly sourced from Statistics SA) and analysis of price time series for forecasting price problem specs.
* [./reports](https://github.com/CharlesRethman/HEA-Analysis-ZA-2016/tree/master/reports): The report and presentations, as well as planning documents
* [./spreadsheets](https://github.com/CharlesRethman/HEA-Analysis-ZA-2016/tree/master/spreadsheets): Baseline Storage Spreadsheets (BSSs) and Outcome Analysis Spreadsheets (OASs) used in this 2016 National Outcome Forecast Analysis (_April-May 2016_). **Note**, there are additional spreadsheets that enable anaylsis of the urban poor, farm workers and people living in open access tenure livelihood zones for which there are not yet proper baselines;
* [./sql](https://github.com/CharlesRethman/HEA-Analysis-ZA-2016/tree/master/sql): The SQL files perform functional processes on the spatial and tabular data sets. In particular, SQL queries are used to determine affected population census Small Areas ans the portions of livelihood zones under diffrent problem specifications, as well as generating population data and enabling mapping functionality with Postgres/PostGIS.
* Problem Specifications: contains data on meterology, crops, prices

For instructions on how to use GitHub and Git with these spreadsheets, see [INSTRUCTIONS.md](https://github.com/CharlesRethman/HEA-Analysis-ZA-2016/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md).



* [./livestock](https://github.com/CharlesRethman/HEA-Analysis-NA-2016/tree/master/livestock): herd dynamics spreadsheet to determine composition of herds;
